   - What: Based on the CRUD acronym, where it means [Create, Read, Update, Delete] information from a server

// What are HTTP Methods?

/*
   In summary, HTTP methods:
   - What: Are actions that can be performed on a resource identified by a URI in the context of the HTTP protocol.
   - Why: Allow clients to manipulate resources on a server, providing semantics for safe and idempotent operations.
*/

/*
   
   How:
   - GET: Retrieves data from the server.
   - POST: Submits data to the server to create a new resource.
   - PUT: Updates an existing resource on the server.
   - DELETE: Removes a resource from the server.
   - PATCH: Partially updates a resource on the server.
   - HEAD: Retrieves metadata about a resource without fetching the resource itself.
   - OPTIONS: Returns the HTTP methods supported by a server for a given resource.
   - TRACE: Echoes back the received request to the client, allowing it to see what changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.
   
   HTTP methods provide a standardized way for clients to interact with web servers, enabling the manipulation of resources in a predictable and efficient manner.
